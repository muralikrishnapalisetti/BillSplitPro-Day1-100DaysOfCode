#  Day 1 – BillSplitPro: Tip & Bill Split Calculator

Welcome to **BillSplitPro**, my first project from the **#100DaysOfCode** challenge! 
This is a user-friendly Python program designed to split a bill among friends and calculate tips dynamically—perfect for group dinners or casual hangouts. 🍕🍻

## 📍 Project Info

- **Project**: BillSplitPro – Tip & Bill Split Calculator  
- **Challenge**: Day 1 of [#100DaysOfCode]  
- **Course**: "100 Days of Code – The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp" by Angela Yu  
- **Tech**: Python

##  What I Built

A smart and interactive console-based bill splitting tool that:
- Calculates how much each person should pay
- Dynamically adjusts based on the tip percentage
- Includes a fun feedback generator based on tipping generosity 😉

##  Features

- Tip % feedback ("You're generous!", "Decent!", "Try to be kinder! 😅")
- Handles invalid inputs using `try-except`
- Clean f-string formatting for clarity
- Fast and functional user interface (console-based)

##  Concepts Practiced

- Variables & Data Types (`int`, `float`, `str`)
- Mathematical Operations (`+`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `round()`)
- String Formatting with `f-strings`
- Basic Error Handling with `try-except`
- User Input & Output Handling

##  Why It Was Exciting

This small but practical project helped reinforce my Python basics. It's simple, interactive, and solves a real-world problem—splitting bills with friends.
